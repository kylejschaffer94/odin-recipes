    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish, optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Fettuccine: In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to the package instructions until it reaches al dente. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add Cream and Parmesan: Pour in the heavy cream, and bring it to a gentle simmer while stirring continuously. Reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Incorporate Parmesan Cheese: Gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese into the simmering cream mixture. Continue to stir until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce thickens. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with Salt and Pepper: Taste the sauce and season with salt and black pepper to your liking. Remember that Parmesan cheese is already salty, so be cautious with the salt.</li>
        <li>Combine Pasta and Sauce: Add the cooked and drained fettuccine pasta directly into the skillet with the Alfredo sauce. Gently toss the pasta until it's evenly coated with the creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve: Plate the creamy Fettuccine Alfredo, garnishing it with chopped fresh parsley if desired. Serve immediately while it's hot, and enjoy the rich and indulgent flavors of this classic pasta dish.</li>
