    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a delectable Italian dish renowned for its rich and comforting flavors. At its core, lasagna consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, typically made from durum wheat semolina, generously smothered with a luscious blend of ingredients. The star of the show is the savory meat sauce, which is often prepared with a combination of ground beef, pork, and aromatic herbs, simmered to perfection in a tomato-based marinara sauce. Each layer of pasta is delicately interspersed with velvety ricotta cheese and mozzarella, creating a harmonious symphony of textures and tastes. The dish is then baked in the oven until the cheese on top turns golden and bubbly, resulting in a mouthwatering, multi-layered masterpiece that's both hearty and indulgent.</p>
    <p>What makes lasagna truly remarkable is its versatility. While the classic meat version is a perennial favorite, vegetarian variations and creative twists have also gained popularity, showcasing ingredients like spinach, mushrooms, or eggplant. Whether served as a comforting family meal or an elegant centerpiece at special gatherings, lasagna is an enduring Italian classic that embodies the warmth and flavor of Italian cuisine, making it a beloved favorite worldwide.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound (450 grams) ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>24-32 ounces (680-900 grams) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>15-16 ounces (425-450 grams) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2-3 cups (200-300 grams) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (50 grams) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1-2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic and sauté until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Brown the Ground Beef: Add the ground beef to the skillet with the onion and garlic. Break it apart with a spoon and cook until it's browned and no longer pink. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add Tomato Sauce: Pour in the tomato sauce and Italian seasoning. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture: In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, eggs, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: In a greased 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish, start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
        <li>Layering: Spread a portion of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a generous sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layering process, alternating between noodles, meat sauce, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella cheese, until you've used up all your ingredients. Make sure the top layer is mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the top is golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Rest and Serve: Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
