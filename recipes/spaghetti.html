    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meatballs: In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and black pepper. Mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Form the Meatballs: Take a portion of the meat mixture and roll it between your hands to form meatballs about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. Repeat until all the mixture is used, typically yielding around 12 meatballs.</li>
        <li>Cook the Meatballs: In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until they are browned on all sides and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Tomato Sauce: In the same skillet, add another 2 tablespoons of olive oil if needed. Add the finely chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Simmer the Tomato Sauce: Pour in the crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce into the skillet with the sautéed onions and garlic. Add sugar (if using), salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if you want some heat). Stir well to combine. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.</li>
        <li>Cook the Spaghetti: In a large pot, bring water to a boil, add a generous pinch of salt, and cook the spaghetti noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine and Serve: Gently place the cooked meatballs into the simmering tomato sauce and let them warm through for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the spaghetti topped with the meatballs and tomato sauce. Garnish with fresh basil leaves and extra grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Enjoy your homemade spaghetti and meatballs!</li>
